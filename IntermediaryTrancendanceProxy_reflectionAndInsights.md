Intermediary Transcendence Proxy exploration of the future of labor that challenges and pushes the limits of Marshall Mcluhan's concepts of media. Specifically the quote:


All media are extensions of some human faculty – psychic or physical


Each scenario explores a technical device’s functionality while putting the power and labor back in the hands of the worker. In the first scenario, the office worker is simply a vessel for a community of outsource workers around the world. The office “worker” falls asleep as contract workers type away getting many jobs done at the same time.


The second scenario explores how labor would change if we had actual workers smelling for hazardous material rather than relying on sensors and machines. Airport workers would walk around with smell wands that detect security threats, while, from a safe distance, workers would wear smelling apparatuses that would allow them to sniff out dangers.


// Process

This project started with my curiosity of how cyber security jobs will evolve in the future. Cyber attacks will continue to occur and will likely be more frequent. This, in combination, with the fact that most attacks are not complex in nature, would make the tasks that need to be carried out much simpler, and something that the average factory worker would be capable of completing.


Envisioning the work environments and devices of future factory cyber security worker allowed me to evolve my focus to start to explore how hackers would could exploit the internet of things. Specifically I began to explore how hackers could exploit medical devices. In the future (and to some degree currently) medical devices connect to the internet making them vulnerable. Incidents like this wouldn't be far off considering the situation in Glendale, CA on February 18th, 2016, where hackers held a hospital for ransom, and the hospital eventually paid 40 bitcoin.

Then I started to question how hacking medical devices, in a more white or grey hat positionality, could be used for good. What if an underground network formed helping the poor get access to devices that relieved people with phantom limb syndrome of the pain they experienced.


Ultimately I felt that focus on medical devices and how they could be hacked/ exploited was to literal and did not address the future of work. But it did start to form a question about how devices of labour would change in a possible future. This is where I began to form the more surreal interpretation of Marshall Mcluhan’s concepts of media.

// Critical Reflection


This is definitely a project I would like to continue to explore. As much as I would like to continue animating new scenarios, I think it would be more productive, and much more powerful to explore options that are more tangible. I’m not sure what media that should be, but it would be interesting to physically make them, or at the very least turn them into an interactive onscreen game of some kind.

//Brief
This is a design project about the future of work. We will develop speculative scenarios that propose new kinds of idiosyncratic and positioned technological (or technology related) experiences which constitute "doing work" in the context of a re-imagined Los Angeles. We will then make these ideas tangible by creating critical narratives, in the form of short films, which incorporate design(ed) elements as settings, props and protagonists.
